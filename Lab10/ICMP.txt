Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)

DHCP - provides IP address
HTTP - Provides Web Content

Why was it discovered?
Want to find if the server is active or if the connection is active or if there are any connectivity problems between the client and the server.

Client-R1-R2-R3-Server

Use ping command to check if the remote server is reachable.
ICMP Echo Request is sent from the client to the server.
The server sends back a ICMP Echo Response.

ICMP operates at layer 3 (ie. even routers can send ICMP)
ICMP request is sen by the network layer. The packet does not reach the transport layer, this is why there are no port numbers in the request.

If the links between the client and the server is broken (eg: the last link between the router and the server is broken, the router cant forward the packet), an alert is sent to the client that connectivity is not possible.

Two instances when router sends a ICMP mesage:
- When router can't send a packet to the destination.
- If the sender sends packets at a very high speed, information piles up at the router storage ("send buffer") (client sends packets faster thant the router). When the storage is getting full, the router sends a ICMP message to the sender, asking the sender to slow down the speed of packet transmission.
This is a case of Flow control mismatch between sender and router.
- When we want to check if a particular server is reachable (done using the ping command)

ICMP datagram structure:
| IP Header | Type | Code | Checksum | Optional Parameters | Data |
	    |           ICMP Header                        |
|           |   1  |   1  |    2     |       4 octets      |      |

Ping statistics for 143.89.14.2:
    Packets: Sent = 10, Received = 8, Lost = 2 (20% loss),
Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
    Minimum = 905ms, Maximum = 1140ms, Average = 1052ms

Each rouer reduces the TTL by one factor. If the TTL becomes 0, the routers stop forwarding th packet to subsequent routers. This will give a "Request time out" message. In this case the router sends a ICMP message (improper) to the sender.

In this case, we got 8 replies and 2 packets were lost. ==> 8 IMCP proper messages.

TTL=48 means that the message reaches the detination within 48 hops, else the packet is lost.

In the ICMP packet, if type is 8 and code is 0 ==> Echo ping request
In the ICMP packet, if type is 0 and code is 0 ==> Echo ping reply

The optional parameters are Identifier and Sequence Number.

The data in the ICMP is the same in the request and the reply (data is in hexa).
